# Book Recommender

This project builds a personlised book recommemder system using K-nearest-neighbours(KNN). The system will then give a list of recommended books based on the user's input of their favourite book. 

**book_recommender.ipynb** is a runnable file that will ask for your input and return a list of books.
**books.csv** is the dataset file.
**reources.ipynb** are some of the links useful and inspirational for doing this project.
**testcases.txt** are some of the inputs kindly contributed by friends and family.
